Hi! To use the patch, download the sh file and execute it either by entering the path in your terminal or by dragging it in to it. 
You have to have Omori on steam for it to work.
Note that we didn't do much work and most (all) of the credit goes the the devs of the silicon patch Snowp and ynx0! (I forked their repo)
